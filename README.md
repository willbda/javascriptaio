# Gamelet

A starter program for writing js games

## Installation

## Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing an element with an id of 'ball'.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js" />
```

2. This script will detect when the left or right arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.
